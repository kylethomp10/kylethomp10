<h1>Hi, I'm Kyle. <br/> Welcome to my portfolio!

<h2>✏️ CAD Projects:</h2>


- <b> Cold Air Intake </b>
<br> For this project, I was completely disassembled an air intake manufactured by K&N. Through extremely meticously measurement I was able to recreate all the individual pieces in SolidWorks. I drew a total of 14 pieces that all ranged in size. The small rubber rings were millimeters in thickness while the large heat shield, shown in black in the picture below was almost a foot long across each side. This project challenged me in finding creative ways to get accurate measurements. I had to measure each side's angle of deflection from the other and calculate their specific geometry to ensure all parts fit together within my required tolerances.

- <b> Dove Tail Gearbox </b>
<br> This design's purpose is to bend an aluminum bar to a 90 degree angle. It utilizes a DC motor to drive the gearbox forward or back. The total gear ratio is 405:1, with 5 gears being used to acheive this.

The output shaft of the gearbox, for the bending device rotates a pinion gear that directly engages a linear rack, shown in green. As the pinion turns, the rack moves forward in a straight line. Attached to the end of the rack is a precision-shaped press tool named the dove tail. The dove tail has a semicircular end which is meant to guide the bar gently as it is bent.

The aluminum strip is placed between the dove tail and the end of the gearbox, which is called the die. As the rack pushes the press tool into the strip, the tool forces the aluminum downward into the die opening, generating the bending moment required to form a bend the bar. The gear train provides the required torque multiplication, while the rack-and-pinion interface ensures smooth, linear motion with good alignment between gears and the end of the box.
